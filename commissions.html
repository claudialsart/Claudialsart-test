    <h1>Commissions</h1>
    <p class="comm-intro">
      I work with collectors to create paintings that carry a personal meaning. Together we define
      palette, mood, and symbolism, shaping a piece that feels both intimate and timeless.

    <h2>The commission process</h2>
    <p>
      Commissioning a painting is a simple, collaborative process. It starts with a short
      conversation about what you have in mind, where the piece will live, and how you want it
      to feel. You do not need a perfect idea. I can guide you with suggestions on size,
      composition, and colour palette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we agree on the concept, size, and price, a deposit secures your spot in my schedule.
      During the painting process I may share progress updates, especially if the piece is very
      personal, so you can feel involved without needing to direct every detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the painting is finished, I will send final photos for approval, then carefully pack it
      and ship it to you. Each work is painted in professional oil colours on quality surfaces and
      finished with a protective varnish once fully dry.
    </p>

    <h2>Pricing guide</h2>
    <p>
      Prices depend on size, level of detail, and the complexity of the idea. To give you a rough
      guide, most commissions fall within these ranges:
    </p>
    <ul class="comm-pricing">
      <li>Small works up to 30 × 40 cm from £300</li>
      <li>Medium works around 40 × 50 cm to 50 × 70 cm from £550</li>
      <li>Larger pieces from 60 × 80 cm and above from £900</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are starting points. After you send your enquiry, I will reply with a clear quote
      based on your idea and chosen size. A deposit, usually around 30 percent, is required to
      begin and is non-refundable once I start the painting.
