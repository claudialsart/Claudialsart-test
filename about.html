      <h2>About the Artist</h2>
      <p>I’m a self-taught Italian artist based in London. I work mostly with oil paint, mixing realism and abstraction to express what I feel through colour and light. My paintings explore the space between what we see and what we sense, inspired by the universe, nature, and human emotions.</p>

      <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
      <p>Painting is where I let my inner world take form. It’s how I translate feelings into colour, texture, and movement when words aren’t enough. I’m inspired by the vastness of space and the small, quiet moments that define us. My work moves between cosmic scenes, abstract realism, and symbols that connect the real with the imagined.</p>
      <p>Becoming a mother changed how I paint. It added depth, honesty, and vulnerability to my work, showing how strength and tenderness can exist together. Each painting is a reflection of what I live and an invitation to look closer and find beauty in both the infinite and the intimate.</p>
