   <h2>About</h2>
<p>I am a self-taught Italian artist based in London, creating oil paintings that weave together realism, abstraction, and dreamlike visions. My work explores the intersection between the tangible and the unseen, often drawing from the cosmos, natural forms, and the intricate layers of human emotion.</p>

    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
 <p>Painting is where my inner world meets the canvas, a place where colour, texture, and light become languages of feeling. Inspired by the vastness of space and the intimacy of human stories, I move between cosmic landscapes, abstract realism, and symbolic detail, always seeking to evoke something beyond the visible.</p>
<p>Motherhood marked a turning point in my practice, infusing my art with a deeper emotional resonance. Each piece I create is both a reflection and an invitation: to pause, to look closer, and to experience beauty that exists in both the infinite and the intimate.</p>
